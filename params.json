{"name":"Mike Moran","tagline":"Nuclear Astrophysics | Python","body":"### ABOUT\r\nI am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Notre Dame, studying nuclear astrophysics under Dr. Michael Wiescher. My research focuses on radiative alpha-capture reactions using the recoil separator St. George. I graduated from Michigan State University in 2011 with degrees in physics and astrophysics.\r\n\r\n### PROGRAMMING\r\nI primarily code in Python, with much of my research code being in C++ extended by the [ROOT Data Analysis Framework](https://root.cern.ch/drupal/), with bash scripting thrown in. I have also used Fortran, [COSY](http://www.bt.pa.msu.edu/index_cosy.htm), and others when necessary.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
