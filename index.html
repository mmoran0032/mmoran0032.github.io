          <p>
            <b><a href="https://github.com/mmoran0032">GitHub</a></b> |
            <b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmoran0032/">LinkedIn</a></b>
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a data scientist at
            <a href="https://www.whiteops.com/"><b>White Ops</b></a>
            on the <i>Detection</i> team, working to identify fraudulent
            activity across the internet and developing new ways to track
            and counteract that activity. I have previously worked on
            building search ranking models and integrating ideas from
            recommender systems into the framework while at
            <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en"><b>Gartner</b></a>,
            analyzing passenger flow through New York's subway system as
            a fellow at
            <a href="https://www.insightdatascience.com/"><b>Insight Data Science</b></a>,
            and commissioning a next-generation recoil mass separator for
            nuclear astrophysics experiments while a graduate student in
            the <a href="https://physics.nd.edu/"><b>Physics Department</b></a>
            at the University of Notre Dame. My work has spanned multiple
            areas of interest, where I've sought out ways that my varied
            skills and expertise can most benefit. That mindset also
            initially attracted me to the
            <a href="https://www.lymanbriggs.msu.edu/"><b>Lyman Briggs College</b></a>
            at Michigan State University, where the multi-disciplinary
            approach to learning the sciences and coupling that with their
            impact on humanity has had a profound impact on my life and
            career.

        <h3><span class="mega-octicon octicon-keyboard"></span> &nbsp; PROGRAMMING</h3>
          <p>
            I've used <a href="https://www.python.org/"><b>Python</b></a>
            for data analysis and side projects since 2007, but have
            worked in most other languages, especially C++ (extended by
            ROOT for nuclear physics analysis), Java, shell scripting,
            Fortran, and some domain-specific languages based on the
            above.
          </p>
          <p>
            While programming itself has been extremely rewarding, I would
            not feel right without helping others in their own journey to
            learn. I taught a summer course on using Python for data
            analysis to undergraduate students with a focus on practical
            applications of Python (see the
            <a href="https://github.com/mmoran0032/reu2016"><b>2016 course information</b></a>
            for additional details) and tutored or guided multiple
            graduate and undergraduate students on their own journey with
            Python.

        <h3><span class="mega-octicon octicon-terminal"></span> &nbsp; PROJECTS</h3>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, my work for my employers cannot be shared here.
            Below are mostly projects that I worked on during my time in
            graduate school in support of my dissertation work, or side
            projects I created while avoiding said dissertation work.
